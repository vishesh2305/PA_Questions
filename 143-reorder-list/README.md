You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

```
L0 &rarr; L1 &rarr; &hellip; &rarr; Ln - 1 &rarr; Ln
```

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

```
L0 &rarr; Ln &rarr; L1 &rarr; Ln - 1 &rarr; L2 &rarr; Ln - 2 &rarr; &hellip;
```

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 104]`.
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`
