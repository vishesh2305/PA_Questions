You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a target element `target`.

A **target index** is an index `i` such that `nums[i] == target`.

Return _a list of the target indices of_ `nums` after_ sorting _`nums`_ in **non-decreasing** order_. If there are no target indices, return _an **empty** list_. The returned list must be sorted in **increasing** order.

 

Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
```

Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 3
Output: [3]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The index where nums[i] == 3 is 3.
```

Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 5
Output: [4]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The index where nums[i] == 5 is 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
	
- `1 <= nums[i], target <= 100`
